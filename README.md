UDACITY FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPER NANODEGREE:  PROJECT 1

HOW TO RUN 'MY FAVOURITE MOVIES' WEB PAGE

About:
This web page presents promotional poster, basic information about and two-minute previews of 16 movies, arranged in a 4x4 table.  The information displayed includes the movie title, year of release, Rotten Tomatoes rating, summative critic review, and reviewer name.  The web page is a modified version of 'Fresh Tomatoes', the Udacity AWS resource, and examples completed by other Udacity students on GitHub were browsed to find out the possibilities before deciding how to modify 'Fresh Tomatoes' for Project 1 of the Udacity FSWD Nanodegree.  

Background: 
When customising 'Fresh Tomatoes', initially an attempt was made to add fade-out cinema curtains with an existing Adobe image, an introductory voice-over, and rearrange the video boxes into two rows of five, before settling to finalise this project with adding more videos to even out the rows, changing the hover highlight to bright red, and adding some extra information about each movie.  This activity has really inspired me to try and write such a web page on my own after the course.
